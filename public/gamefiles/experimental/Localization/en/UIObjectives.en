UI.Objectives.FleetScreenCanvas.DesignDataShipDV.Desc=<L424><h>Delta-V</h>, measured in kps (kilometers per second), is the critical stat for determining where a ship can go and how fast it can get there. Increasing the number of a ship's Propellant Tanks increases Delta-V capacity, while more Mass on a ship decreases it.<br><br>As ship Drive Modules increase their exhaust velocity value they will expend less propellant to achieve the same thrust.<br><br>A ship with less than 8 kps Delta-V may have trouble reaching the Moon from an Earth orbit. A ship with less than 20 kps Delta-V will not be able to reliably perform interplanetary transfers from Earth. Trips to the outer planets or ships intended to maneuver frequently in combat will require more Delta-V. A ship with a low Delta-V capacity may have to wait for a favorable alignment of planets, called a <h>Launch Window</h>, before it can depart.

UI.Tutorial.VO.1=Greetings Commander, I am Fiona Ayoade, your chief of staff. I'll be briefing you on the situation.
UI.Tutorial.VO.2=Our council is made up of some of the Earth's best and brightest. They are capable, connected and standing by for your orders.
UI.Tutorial.VO.3=If we truly face the threat of invasion, we need to start organizing now. We are going to need global cooperation on a never-before-seen scale. I recommend we start tasking our councilors with gaining support in strategic positions of power across the globe.
UI.Tutorial.VO.4=Reports are still coming in but it is clear that an alien object has crashed down on the planet. We should send a councilor to investigate the site as soon as possible.
UI.Tutorial.VO.5=This is your main command interface. From here we can monitor developments across the globe and beyond; send our councilors on missions; direct research and development; and much more. Take some time to familiarize yourself with it.
UI.Tutorial.VO.6=Information about our currently selected councilor appears in the bottom-right of the screen. Their available missions can be found in the bottom-center of the screen.
UI.Tutorial.VO.7=It will be critical for us to not lose sight of our goals. I will keep this screen updated with our current objectives.

UI.Tutorial.VO.9=Our researchers are asking for your guidance in directing their efforts.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10=This is the research screen. The top three charts display what the global scientific community is working on. The bottom charts show what council engineering projects we are privately pursuing. We can direct our researchers to prioritize any or all of these options.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10a=This is the Tech Tree. Our researchers have extrapolated out what different scientific breakthroughs could lead to.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10b=This is the Tech Tree. Our researchers have extrapolated out what different scientific breakthroughs could lead to. Frankly Commander, if I look at it too long I get a headache, and they say this is the simple one.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10c=And this, is the "complete" one…
UI.Tutorial.VO.10d=Commander, you have been staring at the tech tree for a while. How about a cup of coffee?
UI.Tutorial.VO.10e=This is the list of all the council engineering projects we can pursue at this time.
UI.Tutorial.VO.10f=These are the research archives where we can find reports on our completed research.
UI.Tutorial.VO.11=Our councilor has gained the support of people in key positions of power in a nation. We should consider what our priorities are for that nation.
UI.Tutorial.VO.12=Our current councilors are stretched thin. I recommend we expand the council.
UI.Tutorial.VO.13=As we expand our operations, we will soon need the support of a large nation.
UI.Tutorial.VO.14=We should make every effort to understand a nation's social and economic situation so we can best direct its development to support our efforts.
UI.Tutorial.VO.15=A nation's priorities determine how it will develop over time. As we gain control points in a nation, we can direct more of its priorities.
UI.Tutorial.VO.16=Remember Commander, we have enemies out there, and not just extraterrestrial ones.
UI.Tutorial.VO.17=Commander, I'd like to introduce you to the Council. Take some time to familiarize yourself with our councilors. They are the backbone of our organization.

UI.Tutorial.VO.20=This is the Nations screen. From here we can keep tabs on all nations we have control points in or view data on all the nations on Earth. This information should prove useful in directing our councilor's missions and in directing the priorities of nations under our control.
UI.Tutorial.VO.20a=The Priority Template Designer allows us to create plans for national development that can be easily reused.
UI.Tutorial.VO.20b=This screen reports on our Control Point Capacity. Managing more control points than we can handle will stress our operations and costs us influence to maintain.
UI.Tutorial.VO.21=Tech Companies, Cartels, Intelligence organizations. Any one of them could be leveraged to give us powerful support.
UI.Tutorial.VO.22=It seems we are not alone. Other faction's councilors are launching missions across the globe.

UI.Tutorial.VO.24=Commander, we are getting reports of an alien ship on its way to Earth.
UI.Tutorial.VO.25=Commander, our contributions to global research have given us the opportunity to steer the scientific community's efforts. What are your orders?
UI.Tutorial.VO.26=Research stations, space docks, resupply hubs, we are going to need it all. When you think we are ready, take the leap into orbit.
UI.Tutorial.VO.27=Our station will be useless without a power generation solution.
UI.Tutorial.VO.28=Time to put our station to work.
UI.Tutorial.VO.29=We are going to need extensive mining operations to support a fleet. Launching a probe will help us gain vital prospecting data.
UI.Tutorial.VO.30=Mining complexes are your primary means of acquiring space resources, which means we won't have to use expensive rockets launched from Earth to build habitats and spacecraft.
UI.Tutorial.VO.31=We will need to build a space dock if we are to start building a war fleet.
UI.Tutorial.VO.32=Finally, we get to build something with a little punch.
UI.Tutorial.VO.33=The war against the aliens can't be won on Earth alone. We should continue constructing warships to defend against and eventually attack the aliens.
UI.Tutorial.VO.34=This is the Habs Screen. From here we can manage our orbital stations and any bases we have on planets, moons, or asteroids. Additionally, we can view any other stations or bases we have discovered.
UI.Tutorial.VO.35=This is the Fleets Screen. From here we can monitor both our own fleets and any other fleets we have detected.
UI.Tutorial.VO.36=From the ship designer we can design new ship classes or plan to refit ships we have already built.
UI.Tutorial.VO.36a=Ships that you design will appear here. We can order ships to be constructed at habs with construction facilities.
UI.Tutorial.VO.37=Selecting a space body allows us to view data on physical properties, mining sites, orbits, and order the construction of stations and bases.
UI.Tutorial.VO.38=When soft power can't do the job, bring in the hardware.
UI.Tutorial.VO.39=The Codex contains crucial information on how to manage our faction's operations. If you have a question, I recommend checking the codex. It will be kept up to date as the situation develops.
